# My goal with this project
This project will be my template for my other projects. Coded some cool stuff in it.
e. g. dynamic level selector : if you add any .tscn files in the res://level it will automatically add it to the level selector(assuming the levels number is the file name, e. g. level 1 -> 1.tscn)
